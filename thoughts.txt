#classic resource
- gamecore classicsiumulation is broken
-> currently all nearby worlds are loaded immedialty after entering a world
   but the client often does not know their resources until requested. 
# clients do not longer request resources from the server
  the server does always send the client a new resource
-> the classicsimulation should be able to delay world initialization when
   the parent needs to
-> the client enters a new world, the loading of other worlds is delayed first.
   the server sends new resources, the client loads all resoruces
# idea -> load every resource, that the server sends (might allow bad thinks?)
- client needs updates for new classicclient changes and now many request
