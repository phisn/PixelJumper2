#classic resource
- classic resource should not be saved as it currently is
-> save it as an sperate database
-- would allow easy statistics (sql)
-> save it in a directory with classicplayer resource
   files. optionally a database with classicplayers
-- would not allow for easy statistics
- simulator has to somehow store unlocks if operator
  is currently not accessible
-> store each unlock individually and run unlock request
   later
-> store classicplayer request and either send only non matching
   unlocks (bad) or send whole new classicplayer request (bad)
- exitable tile event currently may remove flexibility
  between simulations
-> remove event and let the simulation just extract this information
   from the classiccontext file. classicsimulation can not accept
   classic context files, because the client also uses the classicsimulation
   but has no access to classiccontext files. therefore the simulator
   simulationrequesethandler has to handle classic context. the parameter
   for the simulationcallback in the handler will change from event to
   a simple unlock or a custom (better) event.
- client needs updates for new classicclient changes and now many request
  adjustments
