- nodes do only represent data from datasets and do not change data directly
- popups are not dependent on nodes but dependent on data. they change data. these changes
  are indirectly (though the window as a taskcontext buffer)  made on the nodes

- contextwindow has no responsibility to handle world properties
  its only responsibility is to handle connections
-> properties like world name are changed in a property window
-> a popup in contextwindow should only contain buttons
- there should be a global window manager that manages all windows
-> a contextwindow could aquire a list of all property windows
   and show them in a list
   [rightclick on world >> context menu opens >> select properties 
    >> new contextmenu opens >> lists all property windows and a 
    create at the bottom to create a new property window]
-> windows are listed from 0 to N and shown as Window #i
-> maybe the manager should have a list of definitions that individually
   manages all windows of a category
